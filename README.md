# Network Analysis

Here you can find the code and data I used for the network analysis videos on Youtube.

Please note that I have truncated the nodes/edges tsv files to increase your runspeed, and because this is still part of an active research project (I'll share the full dataset soon)!

Nodes/edges data comes from the China Biographical Database

The Pride and Prejudice text comes from gutenberg.org, and the names list from Wikipedia.
