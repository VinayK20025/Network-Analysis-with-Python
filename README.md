A network analysis consists of finding voltages, and currents, across all components of a network. Calculating these values involves a variety of techniques.
We can use it in studying the structure of relationships in social networks, the structure or process of change in natural phenomena, or even the analysis of biological systems of organisms.
 
Analyzing this network helps in
- Identifying the most influent person/people in a group
- Defining characteristics of groups of users
- Prediction of suitable items for users
- Identifying CM targets ,etc.

We have used Python as our Programming Language for the Tool.
